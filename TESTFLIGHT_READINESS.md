  - Development section hidden in Release builds
- **Impact:** No test/debug UI exposed to TestFlight users

#### 3. Print Statements Cleaned Up
- **Status:** ✅ 70% Complete (121/173)
- **Critical files cleaned (100%):**
  - `InsightViewModel.swift` (39 statements)
  - `SupabaseService.swift` (39 statements)

#### 4. SupabaseConfig.swift Secured
- **Status:** ✅ Complete ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**
- **Changes:**
  - Removed from git tracking
  - File remains in `.gitignore`
  - Template file (`SupabaseConfig.swift.template`) still tracked
- **⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:**
  - **Supabase credentials are still in git history!**
  - **RECOMMENDED ACTION:** Rotate your Supabase anon key
  - **How to rotate:**
    1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API
    2. Generate new anon key
    3. Update `MeetMemento/Resources/SupabaseConfig.swift` locally
    4. Test authentication still works

- **Covers:**
  - Acceptable use policy
  - User content rights
  - AI disclaimer
  - Liability limitations

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

### 1. Supabase Security
**SEVERITY:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

Your Supabase credentials (URL + anon key) were committed to git history. While removed from future commits, they're still visible in past commits.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Rotate Supabase anon key in dashboard
2. Update local `SupabaseConfig.swift`
3. Test app still works
4. Consider using environment variables for future keys

**Why This Matters:**
- Anyone with repo access can see old commits
- Public repos expose credentials to entire internet
- Malicious actors could abuse your Supabase project

### 2. Email Address in Legal Docs
**SEVERITY:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**

Privacy Policy and ToS currently use placeholder: `sebastian.mendo@example.com`

**Action Required:**
- Update to real support email before hosting
- Ensure email is monitored for legal/privacy requests

### 3. Legal Document Hosting
**SEVERITY:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**

Privacy Policy and ToS must be publicly accessible URLs for:
- Apple Sign In approval
- Google OAuth approval
- App Store submission

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free, Easy)
# 1. Create gh-pages branch
# 2. Add PRIVACY_POLICY.md and TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md
# 3. URLs: https://yourusername.github.io/MeetMemento/privacy

# Option 2: Simple Website
# Host on Vercel, Netlify, or CloudFlare Pages (all free)
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Bundle Identifier Consistency Matters**
   - Used testing IDs throughout development
   - Required global search/replace to fix
   - Best practice: Set correct ID from project start

2. **Debug Code Needs Conditional Compilation**
   - Found debug views accessible in production
   - Used `#if DEBUG` to wrap test features
   - Prevents embarrassing exposure to users

3. **Secrets Don't Belong in Git**
   - SupabaseConfig.swift was tracked with credentials
   - Even `.gitignore` doesn't remove history
   - Use templates + local config from day one

4. **Print Statements Add Up**
   - 173 print statements found across codebase
   - Most in production code paths
   - Cleaned 70% (all critical paths)
   - Remainder in debug tools/previews

5. **Legal Docs Are Non-Negotiable**
   - Apple/Google require Privacy Policy + ToS
   - Must be hosted at public URLs
   - Can use templates but must customize
   - Review annually for accuracy
