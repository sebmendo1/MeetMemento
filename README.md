# MeetMemento

A journaling app with AI-powered insights.

## Setup

### 1. Supabase Configuration

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The Supabase configuration file is not included in version control for security reasons.

1. Copy the template file:
   ```bash
   cp MeetMemento/Resources/SupabaseConfig.swift.template MeetMemento/Resources/SupabaseConfig.swift
   ```

2. Open `SupabaseConfig.swift` and replace placeholders with your actual credentials:
   - Get your Supabase URL and anon key from: [Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

3. **Never commit** `SupabaseConfig.swift` to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`)

### 2. Build & Run

1. Open `MeetMemento.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your target device/simulator
3. Build and run (⌘R)
