# Follow-Up Questions Feature - Complete Removal Plan

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Purpose:** Remove all code and infrastructure related to the DigDeeperView AI-generated follow-up questions feature
**Impact:** Will significantly reduce codebase complexity and remove unused backend infrastructure

---

## 📋 Overview

The follow-up questions feature included:
- AI-generated weekly questions based on journal entries
- TF-IDF algorithm for question relevance
- Database storage and completion tracking
- Edge functions for automated question generation
- Success screens and UI components

After pivoting to show InsightsView (themes/summaries) instead of DigDeeperView (questions), this entire system is now unused.

## 🗂️ Files to Delete

### 1. ViewModels (2 files)
```
MeetMemento/ViewModels/
├─ GeneratedQuestionsViewModel.swift  ❌ DELETE
└─ QuestionGenerationTracker.swift    ❌ DELETE (if exists - check first)
```

**Purpose:** Managed AI-generated question state and completion tracking

---

### 2. Models (2 files)
```
MeetMemento/Models/
├─ GeneratedFollowUpQuestion.swift  ❌ DELETE
└─ FollowUpQuestion.swift          ❌ DELETE
```

**Details:**
- `GeneratedFollowUpQuestion`: AI-generated questions from database
- `FollowUpQuestion`: Legacy hardcoded questions with categories

---

### 3. Services (1-2 files)
```
MeetMemento/Services/
├─ SupabaseService+FollowUpQuestions.swift  ❌ DELETE
└─ QuestionGenerationTracker.swift          ❌ DELETE (if exists)
```

**Purpose:** Supabase API calls for question CRUD operations

---

### 4. UI Components (3 files)
```
MeetMemento/Components/Cards/
├─ FollowUpCard.swift          ❌ DELETE
└─ FollowUpQuestionCard.swift  ❌ DELETE

MeetMemento/Views/Journal/
└─ JournalCreatedView.swift    ❌ DELETE
```

**Details:**
- `FollowUpCard`: Card showing a question with completion state
- `FollowUpQuestionCard`: Alternative card component
- `JournalCreatedView`: Success animation shown after answering a question

---

### 5. Archived Views (1 file)
```
MeetMemento/Views/Journal/
└─ DigDeeperView.swift.backup  ❌ DELETE
```

**Note:** Already archived, safe to delete permanently

---

### 6. Edge Functions (2 directories)
```
supabase/functions/
├─ generate-follow-up/         ❌ DELETE ENTIRE DIRECTORY
│  ├─ index.ts
│  ├─ tfidf.ts
│  ├─ precompute.ts
│  ├─ question-bank.ts
│  ├─ types.ts
│  └─ (test files, backups)
│
└─ weekly-question-generator/  ❌ DELETE ENTIRE DIRECTORY
   └─ index.ts
```

**Purpose:**
- `generate-follow-up`: TF-IDF algorithm + question generation
- `weekly-question-generator`: Cron job for weekly automation

---

### 7. Database Migrations (4 files)
```
supabase/migrations/
├─ 20250118000000_follow_up_questions_table.sql        ❌ DELETE (or keep for history)
├─ 20251021140000_improve_complete_question_rpc.sql    ❌ DELETE (or keep for history)
└─ 20251021150000_fix_complete_question_rpc.sql        ❌ DELETE (or keep for history)
```

**Decision:**
- **Option A (Recommended):** Keep migration files but comment them out (for historical record)
- **Option B:** Delete entirely if you want a clean slate

**Note:** The `follow_up_questions` table in production database should be dropped via a new migration.

---

### 8. Documentation (6+ files)

```

**Action:** Move to `.claude-instructions/archive/follow-up-questions/` for reference

---

## ✏️ Files to Modify (Code Cleanup)

### 1. **ContentView.swift**
**Remove:**
- Line 14-16: `case followUp(String)` enum case (legacy)
- Line 17: `case followUpGenerated(...)` enum case (database)
- Lines 81-112: Both followUp route handlers in navigationDestination
- Lines 131-139: `showJournalCreated` state and fullScreenCover

**Keep:**
- `case create` and `case edit(Entry)` routes

**Before:**
```swift
public enum EntryRoute: Hashable {
    case create
    case edit(Entry)
    case followUp(String)
    case followUpGenerated(questionText: String, questionId: UUID)
}

@State private var showJournalCreated = false

// navigationDestination handlers for followUp cases
// fullScreenCover for JournalCreatedView
```

**After:**
```swift
public enum EntryRoute: Hashable {
    case create
    case edit(Entry)
}

// Remove showJournalCreated state
// Remove followUp navigationDestination handlers
// Remove JournalCreatedView fullScreenCover
```

---

### 2. **AddEntryView.swift**
**Remove:**
- Line 15: `case followUp(questionText: String, questionId: UUID?)` from EntryState enum
- Lines 52-54: followUp initialization case
- Lines 60-78: All computed properties (isFollowUpEntry, followUpQuestionText, questionId)
- Line 35: Remove `questionId` parameter from onSave callback

**Before:**
```swift
public enum EntryState: Hashable {
    case create
    case edit(Entry)
    case followUp(questionText: String, questionId: UUID?)
}

let onSave: (_ title: String, _ text: String, _ questionId: UUID?) -> Void
```

**After:**
```swift
public enum EntryState: Hashable {
    case create
    case edit(Entry)
}

let onSave: (_ title: String, _ text: String) -> Void
```

---

### 3. **EntryViewModel.swift**
**Remove:**
- Line 17: `completedFollowUpQuestions` property (legacy tracking)
- Lines 21-22: `questionsViewModel` property (database tracking)
- Lines 164-254: Entire `createFollowUpEntry` method
- Lines 296-338: `allFollowUpQuestions` computed property (if exists)

**Keep:**
- `createEntry` method (regular journal entries)
- `updateEntry`, `deleteEntry`, `loadEntries` methods

**Impact:** Simplifies ViewModel by ~100 lines

---

### 4. **Entry.swift**
**Decision Required:**

**Option A (Minimal Change):** Keep `isFollowUp` field but stop using it
```swift
public var isFollowUp: Bool // Keep for backward compatibility
```

**Option B (Clean Removal):** Remove field entirely
```swift
// Remove isFollowUp field
// Remove from CodingKeys
// Remove from init
// Remove from decoder
```

**Recommendation:** Option B - clean removal, but requires database column removal

---

### 5. **SupabaseService.swift**
**Check for:**
- Any follow-up question related methods that might be defined in the main service file
- Import statements for `SupabaseService+FollowUpQuestions`

**Remove:** Any imports or extensions referencing follow-up questions

---

### 6. **Theme.swift** (Check Only)
**Search for:**
```swift
// Look for any follow-up specific color definitions
```

**Action:** Remove if found (unlikely, but check)

---

## 🗄️ Database Cleanup

### Create New Migration: `drop_follow_up_questions.sql`

```sql
-- Drop follow_up_questions table and related objects
-- Run this AFTER deploying code changes

-- Drop RPC functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS complete_follow_up_question(uuid, uuid);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_current_week_questions();

-- Drop indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_follow_up_questions_user_week;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_follow_up_questions_completion;

-- Drop table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS follow_up_questions;

-- Drop any related policies (RLS)
-- (These will auto-drop with the table, but explicit for clarity)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own questions" ON follow_up_questions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own questions" ON follow_up_questions;

-- Optional: Drop entries.is_follow_up column
ALTER TABLE entries DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_follow_up;
```

**Deployment Order:**
1. ✅ Deploy code changes first (remove all Swift code)
2. ✅ Test app thoroughly without follow-up features
3. ✅ Run database migration to drop tables
4. ✅ Undeploy edge functions from Supabase dashboard

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Lines of Code Removed
| Category | Files | Est. Lines |
|----------|-------|------------|
| ViewModels | 2 | ~350 |
| Models | 2 | ~150 |
| Services | 1-2 | ~200 |
| UI Components | 3 | ~400 |
| Views | 1 | ~360 |
| Edge Functions | 2 dirs | ~1500 |
| Code cleanup | 4 files | ~200 |
| **TOTAL** | **~15 files** | **~3,160 lines** |

### Benefits
✅ **Reduced complexity** - Remove entire question generation subsystem
✅ **Faster builds** - Fewer files to compile
✅ **Lower Supabase costs** - Remove edge function execution
✅ **Cleaner codebase** - Easier to understand and maintain
✅ **No database overhead** - Remove follow_up_questions table

### Risks
⚠️ **Breaking changes** - Existing users with questions will lose them
⚠️ **Database migration required** - Must carefully drop tables
⚠️ **No rollback path** - Once removed, difficult to restore

## 📝 Notes

### Why Keep Some Migrations?
Keeping old migration files (commented out) provides:
- Historical record of database schema evolution
- Easier debugging if issues arise
- Documentation of what was tried

### Why Remove JournalCreatedView?
The success animation was specifically designed for answering follow-up questions. Without that feature, it's just unnecessary complexity.

### Alternative: Feature Flag
If you might want to bring this back later, consider:
```swift
struct FeatureFlags {
    static let followUpQuestionsEnabled = false
}
```

But for maximum cleanup, complete removal is recommended.
