# ✅ Implementation Complete: AI-Generated Follow-Up Questions

**Date:** January 18, 2025
**Status:** All code changes applied - Ready for testing!

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Backend (Already Deployed)
- ✅ TF-IDF algorithm with unified IDF, stemming, 150+ stop words
- ✅ `generate-follow-up` edge function (improved algorithm)
- ✅ `weekly-question-generator` cron function
- ✅ `follow_up_questions` database table with RLS policies
- ✅ Database migration complete

### iOS App (Just Completed)
- ✅ **Phase 1:** Added 3 Swift files to Xcode (manual step - you did this)
- ✅ **Phase 2:** Updated JournalView with database integration
  - Replaced hardcoded questions with database-backed questions
  - Added 6 different UI states (empty, loading, waiting for Sunday, all completed, etc.)
  - Added progress counter (e.g., "3/5" completed)
  - Added pull-to-refresh to fetch new questions

- ✅ **Phase 3:** Updated EntryViewModel with database completion tracking
  - Added `questionsViewModel` reference
  - Updated `createFollowUpEntry()` to accept optional `questionId`
  - Marks questions as completed in database (with fallback to legacy in-memory tracking)

- ✅ **Phase 4:** Updated EntryRoute enum
  - Added `.followUpGenerated(questionText: String, questionId: UUID)` case
  - Maintains backwards compatibility with legacy `.followUp(String)` case

- ✅ **Phase 5:** Updated ContentView navigation handler
  - Handles new `followUpGenerated` route
  - Passes `questionId` to `createFollowUpEntry()` for database tracking
  - Legacy questions still work without questionId

- ✅ **Phase 6:** No changes needed to AddEntryView ✨
  - Already receives `followUpQuestion` parameter correctly
  - ContentView handles the question ID logic

## 🧪 Next Step: Build & Test

### Step 1: Build the Project

**In Xcode:**
1. Press **⌘B** (Build)
2. Verify **no errors**
3. If you get errors about missing files, make sure you added all 3 Swift files to the project

**Expected:** Build succeeds ✅

---

### Step 2: Run the App

1. Press **⌘R** (Run)
2. Sign in with your account
3. Navigate to the app

**What to test:**

#### Test A: Entry Requirement (< 3 entries)
1. If you have entries, delete them all (or use a test account with 0 entries)
2. Navigate to **"Dig Deeper"** tab
3. **Expected:** Shows "No entries yet" message
4. Create 1 entry
5. **Expected:** Shows "Write 2 more entries" message
6. Create 2nd entry
7. **Expected:** Shows "Write 1 more entry" message

#### Test B: Waiting for Questions State
1. Create 3rd entry
2. Navigate to **"Dig Deeper"** tab
3. **Expected:** Either:
   - Loading spinner (if fetching from database)
   - "New questions coming soon" (if no questions generated yet)

#### Test C: Generate Questions Manually
Since the cron runs on Sundays, you'll need to generate questions manually for testing:

**Option 1: Via Terminal (Fastest)**
```bash
# In Xcode, add this temporary code to any view:
Button("Generate Questions") {
    Task {
        if let token = try? await SupabaseService.shared.supabase?.auth.session.accessToken {
            print("🔑 TOKEN: \(token)")
        }
    }
}

# Tap the button, copy the token from console
export JWT_TOKEN="paste_token_here"

# Run test script
cd /Users/sebastianmendo/Swift-projects/MeetMemento
bash TEST_QUESTIONS.sh
```

**Option 2: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fhsgvlbedqwxwpubtlls/editor
2. Click "SQL Editor"
3. Run this SQL to manually trigger generation:
```sql
-- Call the generate function (requires service role access)
SELECT * FROM follow_up_questions
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY generated_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Option 3: Call Edge Function Directly**
Add this button to any view temporarily:
```swift
Button("Generate Questions Now") {
    Task {
        do {
            let response = try await SupabaseService.shared.generateFollowUpQuestions(
                lookbackDays: 14,
                saveToDatabase: true
            )
            print("✅ Generated \(response.questions.count) questions!")
            print("📊 Analyzed \(response.metadata.entriesAnalyzed) entries")
        } catch {
            print("❌ Error: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

#### Test D: Questions Display
After generating questions:
1. Navigate to **"Dig Deeper"** tab
2. Pull to refresh (swipe down)
3. **Expected:**
   - See 5 personalized questions
   - Progress counter shows "0/5"
   - Each question has circle with chevron (uncompleted)
   - Questions are relevant to your journal entries

#### Test E: Question Completion
1. Tap first question
2. Write and save an entry
3. Return to **"Dig Deeper"** tab
4. **Expected:**
   - First question shows checkmark ✓
   - Text is struck through
   - Progress counter shows "1/5"
5. Tap the completed question again
6. **Expected:** Can still create another entry (questions are reusable)

#### Test F: All Completed State
1. Answer all 5 questions
2. Navigate to **"Dig Deeper"** tab
3. **Expected:**
   - Shows "All caught up!" message
   - Says "New personalized questions will arrive next Sunday"
   - No question cards visible

#### Test G: Database Verification
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fhsgvlbedqwxwpubtlls/editor
2. Click "Table Editor" → `follow_up_questions`
3. **Expected:**
   - See 5 rows for your user
   - `week_number` matches current week
   - `year` is 2025
   - Completed questions have `is_completed = true`
   - Completed questions have `entry_id` populated

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Error: "Cannot find type 'GeneratedFollowUpQuestion'"
**Solution:** You haven't added the 3 Swift files to Xcode yet
1. Open Xcode project
2. Drag the 3 files from Finder into project navigator
3. ✅ "Copy items if needed"
4. ✅ "Add to target: MeetMemento"

### Build Error: "Value of type 'SupabaseService' has no member 'fetchCurrentWeekQuestions'"
**Solution:** `SupabaseService+FollowUpQuestions.swift` not added to Xcode
1. Make sure the file is in the Services folder
2. Add it to Xcode project

### Runtime: Shows "New questions coming soon" forever
**Solution:** No questions generated yet
1. Generate questions manually (see Test C above)
2. Pull to refresh on "Dig Deeper" tab

### Runtime: Questions don't mark as completed
**Solution:** Check console for error messages
1. Look for "❌ Failed to mark question as completed"
2. Verify database function exists: `complete_follow_up_question()`
3. Check database migration ran successfully

### Runtime: Similarity scores are low (< 0.2)
**Solution:** This is expected if you have very few or very generic entries
1. Write more detailed entries (3-4 sentences each)
2. Ensure entries have specific topics (work, relationships, goals, etc.)
3. Expected scores: 0.3-0.6 for good matches

## 🚀 Enable Weekly Automation

Once testing is complete, enable the cron schedule:

### Enable Cron in Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fhsgvlbedqwxwpubtlls/functions
2. Click **weekly-question-generator**
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Under "Cron Schedule":
   - Enable: ✅ **Yes**
   - Schedule: `0 21 * * 0` (Every Sunday 9 PM UTC)
   - Click **Save**

**What happens:**
- Every Sunday at 9 PM UTC, cron runs automatically
- Finds all users with ≥1 entry in last 30 days
- Generates 5 personalized questions for each user
- Saves to database for the current week
- Monday: Users open app and see fresh questions!

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Cron Logs
```bash
# Real-time logs
supabase functions logs weekly-question-generator --tail

# Look for:
# ✅ "Found X active users"
# ✅ "Generated 5 questions for user..."
# ✅ "Successful: X / Failed: 0"
```

### Check Database Activity
```sql
-- See recent questions across all users
SELECT
    user_id,
    question_text,
    relevance_score,
    is_completed,
    week_number,
    year,
    generated_at
FROM follow_up_questions
ORDER BY generated_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
