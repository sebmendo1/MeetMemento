===== COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE FOR CLAUDE CODE TERMINAL =====

I need you to systematically identify and delete deprecated files from the MeetMemento codebase.

DEFINITION OF DEPRECATED FILE:
A file is deprecated if it has ZERO references from:
- Other Swift files (no imports, no instantiation, no method calls)
- Edge functions or backend services
- Database queries or migrations
- Runtime usage (dynamic loading, string references)
- Xcode project configuration

SCOPE:
Analyze all files added/modified in commit 622e5c9 (Memento-v1.1 branch), specifically:
- Swift files in MeetMemento/Views/Onboarding/
- Swift files in MeetMemento/Components/
- Swift files in MeetMemento/Services/
- Swift files in MeetMemento/Models/
- Edge functions in supabase/functions/

EXCLUDE FROM DELETION:
- Database migrations (never delete applied migrations)
- Configuration files (.xcconfig, Info.plist, Package.swift)
- Cron jobs / scheduled tasks (e.g., weekly-question-generator)
- Test files
- Documentation

TASK PHASES:

PHASE 1 - ANALYSIS (DO THIS FIRST):
For each file in scope, use grep to find ALL references:
1. Search for class/struct/enum name in all .swift files
2. Search for filename (without extension) in all code
3. Search for edge function names in Swift code
4. Check for any dynamic references (string literals)

Create a report with 3 categories:
- SAFE TO DELETE: Zero references confirmed
- REVIEW REQUIRED: Ambiguous, may have indirect references
- KEEP: Active references found

Format the report as:
```
SAFE TO DELETE (X files, ~Y lines):
1. path/to/file.swift (N lines)
   - Reason: [why deprecated]
   - References found: NONE
   - Dependencies: [other deprecated files it references]

REVIEW REQUIRED (Z files):
[list with explanations]

KEEP (W files):
[list with reasons]
```

PHASE 2 - DELETION PLAN (WAIT FOR MY APPROVAL):
After Phase 1 report is approved:
1. Group files into logical batches (by feature)
2. Determine deletion order (delete dependents before dependencies)
3. Create git commands for each batch
4. Present plan for approval

PHASE 3 - EXECUTION (ONLY AFTER PLAN APPROVAL):
1. Create backup branch: git checkout -b backup/pre-cleanup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
2. Execute deletions using git rm
3. Commit each batch with descriptive messages
4. Verify app builds after each batch
5. Create summary commit

SEARCH COMMANDS TO USE:

For Swift class/struct references:
grep -r "ThemesIdentifiedView" MeetMemento/ --include="*.swift" | grep -v "^MeetMemento/Views/Onboarding/ThemesIdentifiedView.swift"

For edge function invocations:
grep -r "new-user-insights" MeetMemento/ --include="*.swift"

For model/type usage:
grep -r "IdentifiedTheme\|ThemeAnalysisResponse" MeetMemento/ --include="*.swift"

FILES SUSPECTED TO BE DEPRECATED (from previous analysis):
1. MeetMemento/Views/Onboarding/ThemesIdentifiedView.swift
2. MeetMemento/Components/ThemeCardFullScreen.swift
3. MeetMemento/Components/QuestionCounterView.swift
4. MeetMemento/Services/ThemeAnalysisService.swift
5. MeetMemento/Models/ThemeAnalysis.swift
6. supabase/functions/new-user-insights/index.ts
7. supabase/functions/new-user-insights/types.ts

START WITH PHASE 1 ANALYSIS ONLY.
Present the report and wait for my approval before proceeding to Phase 2.
