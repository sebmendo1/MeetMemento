## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Entries Don't Appear
**Symptom**: JournalView shows empty state  
**Cause**: Mock data not loading  
**Fix**: Check `EntryViewModel.init()` calls `loadMockEntries()`

### Issue 2: Can't Edit Entry
**Symptom**: Edit button doesn't work  
**Cause**: Entry not passed to JournalPageView  
**Fix**: Verify `selectedEntry` binding in JournalView

### Issue 3: Delete Doesn't Work
**Symptom**: Entry doesn't disappear  
**Cause**: ViewModel not connected  
**Fix**: Verify `entryViewModel.deleteEntry(id:)` is called

### Issue 4: Keyboard Doesn't Dismiss
**Symptom**: Keyboard stuck on screen  
**Cause**: Focus state not cleared  
**Fix**: Tap "Done" on keyboard toolbar
