## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Option 1: Start Sprint 1 Now (Recommended)

1. **Read the sprint plan**:
   ```bash
   open .sprints/sprint-01-insights-viewmodel.md
   ```

2. **Get the code**:
   ```bash
   open INSIGHTS_CACHING_INTEGRATION.md
   ```
   - All code is ready to copy-paste
   - Step 1 has full ViewModel implementation

3. **Create the files**:
   ```
   MeetMemento/
   ├── Models/
   │   └── Insights.swift (NEW)
   └── ViewModels/
       └── InsightsViewModel.swift (NEW)
   ```

4. **Copy, build, test**:
   - Copy code from integration guide
   - Build project (⌘B)
   - Check console for cache logs
   - Verify it compiles

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Difficulty**: Easy (code is ready)

### Option 2: Start Sprint 7 First (User Stats)

If you want to see immediate results:

1. Display user statistics from `user_stats` table
2. Show total entries, words, streaks
3. Independent from insights work
4. Quick win!

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Difficulty**: Easy

### Option 3: Wait for Sprint 4 Requirements

If you want to provide OpenAI code first:

1. Share your OpenAI integration approach
2. We'll integrate it directly into Sprint 4
3. Then do Sprints 1-4 in sequence

---

## 📦 What You'll Need for Sprint 4

When you're ready to share, please provide:

### 1. OpenAI Integration Code
```swift
// How do you call OpenAI?
// Example structure we need:

func analyzeJournal(entries: [Entry]) async throws -> AIResponse {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

### 2. Prompt Templates
```
System prompt: "You are an empathetic journal analyst..."
User prompt format: "Analyze these entries: ..."
```

### 3. Configuration
- Which model? (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.)
- Temperature setting?
- Max tokens?
- Any special formatting?

### 4. Response Format
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "title": "...",
    "body": "..."
  },
  "themes": ["...", "..."]
}
```

**Once provided**: We'll integrate it into the ViewModel in Sprint 4!
